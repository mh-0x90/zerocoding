### **Welcome to the Pac-Man Challenge!**

This is a modern, multiplayer version of the classic arcade game, built with HTML, JavaScript, and some powerful AI and cloud features. The main goal remains the same: navigate the maze, eat all the pellets, and avoid the ghosts! You'll control Pac-Man using the arrow keys on your keyboard. As you progress, you'll notice the game has several unique features designed for this event, connecting all participants in a shared digital space. Pay attention to the power pellets in the cornersâ€”they are your key to turning the tables on those pesky ghosts.

### **The Global Leaderboard**

On the left side of the screen, you'll see the **live leaderboard**. This isn't just your personal high score; it's a real-time ranking of every participant in this event. When you start the game, you'll be asked for a name, which is then saved in your browser. Every time you eat a pellet or a ghost, your score is instantly updated and sent to a shared database. The leaderboard automatically sorts players by their score and remaining lives, so you can always see who's in the lead. Use it to fuel your competitive spirit and aim for the top spot!

### **Real-Time Translated Chat**

On the right side of the screen is the **live chat box**, which connects you with every other player. You can share tips, celebrate high scores, or just chat. This feature has a unique twist: to ensure everyone can communicate, an AI agent automatically translates any message you type into English before it's sent. The chat will even show the original message in parentheses, so you can see the translation in action. Additionally, you can type special commands like `/weather [city]` to fetch and display real-world weather data, which can even change the theme of your game board.

### **Your AI Assistant**

If you ever find yourself trapped or unsure where to go, you have an **AI assistant** at your disposal. Clicking the **"ASK AI"** button will pause the game and send the current positions of Pac-Man and the ghosts to an advanced AI model. The AI will quickly analyze your situation and provide a concise, strategic recommendation, telling you which ghosts are the most immediate threat and which direction offers the best escape route. Use this tool wisely to get out of tight spots and extend your game.
